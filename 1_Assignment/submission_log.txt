Below the  header is the body which consists of the  recent questions section (on the left) and a sign in section (on the right). The recent questions section displays five of the  most recent questions posted on the site, these questions are shown in cells which layout is as follows, on the left are two arrows (up and down) which display the rating of the question, these can also be used by the user to up-vote or down-vote the question. Next to these is the question which has a header and a body, at the bottom right is the date of the question posted displayed and on the top right is the username and avatar of the person who posted the question displayed.

The recent questions section now displayes more than five questions and each cell shows how many responses each cell has, the cells can also be pressed to redirect the user to the  question details page.

Below that link is a preview displayed of some of the users questions, these can be pressed which redirect the user to the questions detail page.	

Question Creation Page:

This page has the same header as the two previously mentioned pages. The body has a questions creation section which is used by the user to create a new  question and post it. This section allows the user to add a title to their question as well as body text which gives more detail about their question.

This takes them to the main page again, with the sign in panel replaced by a user details panel.  In that panel they click the My Questions link, that takes them to the Question Management Page, where they can see their questions, sorted in ascending age by default, as well as their user stats.  From there they click the Create Question button, which takes them to the Question Creation page.  After filling it out they hit the Post button, which takes them back to their Question Management Page.  Finally, they click on the Site Name which takes them back to the Main Page, so they can verify that their new question now heads the list of most recent questions.

Storyboard 2:

Story Board 2 shows a user going to the main page before being logged in. They enter their username and password and on the panel to the right, and then they click the sign in button. After the users cridentials have been verified they are redirected to the main page after login. This is where the user looks at a question and then press on that questions 'cell', this then redirects the user to the question details page. The user then sees a response shown under the question  and then decides to down vote (dislike) the response by pressing on the down facing arroww which is on the bottom left of the responce cell. At the very bottom the user then gives their own response by typing it into the text field provided, after this they press on the post button which is below and to the right of users response text field.
